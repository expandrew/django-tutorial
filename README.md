Just going through the [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/). This is for me.

## Duh

- Install Python (with Homebrew): `% brew install python`
- Install Django (with PyPI): `% pip install django`
- New Project: `% django-admin startproject mysite`
- Start server: `% python manage.py runserver`
- Start shell: `% python manage.py shell`
- Run tests: `% python manage.py test polls` (replace `polls` with application name)
